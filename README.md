# Minecraft-Bedrock-Modpack-Maker
Simple tool to combine multiple addons into one. Not finished! Any contributing is welcome.

# How to use:
Move all .mcpack files into the folder that the script is in. CHange the .RPmanifest.json and the .BPmanifest.json to be what you want. This is not finished, sadly, so it will not work.

# Development is on the branch 'dev-with-testing-files'
