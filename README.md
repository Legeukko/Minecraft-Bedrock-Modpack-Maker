# Minecraft-Bedrock-Modpack-Maker
Simple tool to combine multiple addons into one. Not finished! Any contributing is welcome.
Note: This is not finished!
# How to use:
Move all .mcpack files into the folder that the script is in. Change the .RPmanifest.json and the .BPmanifest.json to be what you want for your manifest.json file. MAke sure to add the UUIDs!
After this, run python3 main.py in the correct directory in terminal, or run the script with python.exe.
